# MCP-powered Agentic RAG using Bright Data and Qdrant

This project implements an automated book writing system using AI agents.
- [Bright Data](https://brdta.com/dailydoseofds) is used to scrape data from the web
- Qdrant as the local vector database.
- Cursor IDE as the MCP client.

## Setup and installations

**Get BrightData API Key**:
- Go to [Bright Data](https://brdta.com/dailydoseofds) and sign up for an account.
- Select "Proxies & Scraping" and create a new "SERP API"
- Select "Native proxy-based access"

```
BRIGHDATA_USERNAME="..."
BRIGHDATA_PASSWORD="..."
```

   ```

## Run the project

First, start a Qdrant docker container as follows (make sure you have downloaded Docker):

   ```bash
   docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
   -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
   qdrant/qdrant
   ```

Next, go to the notebook.ipynb file, run the code to create a collection in your vector database.

Finally, set up your local MCP server as follows:
- Go to Cursor settings
- Select MCP 
- Add new global MCP server.

In the JSON file, add this:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "mcp-rag-app": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["/absolute/path/to/server.py"],
          "host": "127.0.0.1",
          "port": 8080,
          "timeout": 30000
      }
  }
}
```

Done! You can now interact with your vector database and fallback to web search if needed.
